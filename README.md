## About This Portfolio

This ePortfolio represents the culmination of my Computer Science program. The included artifacts demonstrate:

- Modular software design and separation of concerns
- Algorithmic problem-solving and structured data management
- Database abstraction and CRUD implementation
- Documentation, maintainability, and defensive programming practices

Each artifact has been revisited and enhanced to meet professional development standards.
